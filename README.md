# GANKCO Nest: upgrade to version 2.0

*Built to support engineered solutions.*

Version 2.0 turns the inventory app into **GANKCO Nest**: one sign-in, then a launcher with **Inventory** now and **Sales & Finance** later.

## Before you start

Ask the team to stop using the app for about 15 minutes. Nothing is lost, but changes made in the middle of the upgrade could fail.

## Step 1: Upgrade the database (Supabase)

1. Open your project in Supabase and go to **SQL Editor → New query**.
2. Open **`1-nest-upgrade.sql`**, copy everything, paste it in and press **Run**. If Supabase warns about "destructive operations", confirm. Wait for **Success**.
3. Start another **New query**. Paste in **`2-nest-history.sql`** and press **Run**. This loads the 17 monthly sheets (Dec 2024 to Oct 2026) so month-to-month comparisons work.

Both files are safe to run again: nothing gets duplicated.

What the upgrade changes:
- Your account becomes **Super Admin**. Everyone else keeps their role (Admin or Staff).
- Every existing admin and staff member is temporarily given **all four service lines**. You narrow this down in step 3.
- The "Main Store" placeholder is renamed **Location not set**. **Port Harcourt** and **Warri** are added.
- Redress-kit items are flagged so their kit numbers and expiry dates can be tracked.

## Step 2: Update the website (GitHub)

1. Unzip **`gankco-nest-v2.0.zip`**.
2. In your `inventory` repository, choose **Add file → Upload files**. Drag in everything from the unzipped folder, including the `js`, `vendor`, `fonts` and `brand` folders, then **Commit**.
3. Don't delete the file called **`CNAME`** in the repository. It keeps `inventory.gankcoenergy.com` working.
4. Optional tidy-up: you can delete the old **`app.js`**, **`favicon.svg`** and **`vendor/xlsx.full.min.js`**. Version 2.0 doesn't use them.
5. Wait 1–2 minutes, then open https://inventory.gankcoenergy.com and press **Ctrl + Shift + R**.

From now on, whenever a new version is published, Nest shows a **"new version available: Reload"** bar, so nobody has to clear their browser.

## Step 3: Set up the team (you, as Super Admin)

Open **Inventory → Team**.

1. **Access:** set your 3 admins to **Admin**. Everyone else stays **Staff**.
2. **Service lines:** press **Lines** next to each person and tick only the line(s) they work in.
3. **Who approves for each line:** choose a **main admin** and a **backup admin** for each line. Their approval requests and alerts go to them. You can approve anything.
4. New people sign up through the link, then appear under **Waiting for approval**. Press **Approve**, tick their line(s), and they're in.

## Step 4: First tasks for each service line

- **Put items in Port Harcourt or Warri.** Everything currently shows as *Location not set*. On Inventory, filter **Location not set**, tick items, then **Move location**. Or use **Excel templates → Item locations**, fill it in, and upload it.
- **Reorder levels:** admins tick items, choose **Edit details**, and set "Reorder at". Low-stock alerts start working.
- **Redress kits:** open a kit item and use **Add / update kit**, or use **Excel templates → Redress kits & expiry dates**. Enter one row per component per kit number. Leave the expiry blank if a component doesn't expire.

## How things work

| Task | Where |
|---|---|
| Send equipment to a job | **Job tickets → New job ticket**. Add items, **Dispatch**, print the **load-out manifest**, then **Record return** when it comes back (good, damaged, used, sold or missing). |
| Correct many numbers at once | **Inventory → Edit quantities**. Type the new numbers, then **Review & submit**. Staff changes go to their line's admin as one request. |
| Monthly count (23rd–26th) | **Monthly count**: start your line's count, tick ✓ or type the real number, then **Submit**. The admin approves, and the month is locked and signed. |
| Approvals | **Approvals**: approve one request, ticked requests, or **Approve all** for a line. Single lines inside a request can be approved or rejected too. |
| Alerts | The **bell** shows low stock, faulty items, certificates and kits expiring, the count window, overdue returns and approvals. Email alerts can be switched on once `noreply@gankcoenergy.com` is ready. |
| Who changed what | **Audit log** (admins). Filter by person, service line, kind of change or date. Edits show the value before and after. |
| Reports | **Reports**: monthly, quarterly, annual, or compare two months. Download as **PDF** or **Excel**. Both are branded and carry the QMS reference. |

## Roles

- **Staff:** day-to-day work in their own service line(s). They can see all stock but not the Setup section.
- **Admin:** approves and manages items for their lines, and also handles locations, labels, new staff and the audit log.
- **Super Admin:** everything, plus creating admins, choosing approvers, settings, and the full audit log.

## Settings

As Super Admin, go to **Settings** to change the count dates, how early kit and certificate warnings appear, and the QMS form details printed on reports.
